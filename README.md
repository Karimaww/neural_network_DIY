# Modular Neural Networks in Python

**Overview:**
Welcome to the Modular Neural Networks project! This Python implementation draws inspiration from earlier versions of PyTorch and similar frameworks that empower the creation of modular and versatile neural networks. In this project, we consider each layer of the neural network as a standalone module, and a network is composed of a collection of these modules. Furthermore, activation functions are also treated as full-fledged modules in their own right.

The core functionality of this library revolves around an abstract class known as 'Module,' which represents a generic neural network module. This modular approach offers immense flexibility in constructing and configuring neural networks, making it adaptable to a wide range of problems and architectural designs.

**Key Features:**
- Create custom neural networks by combining various layers and activation functions.
- Benefit from a clear and organized structure for easy network configuration.
- Achieve powerful and modular solutions for neural network implementation in Python.

This project aims to provide a robust and flexible solution for building neural networks in Python, enabling to craft tailored networks while maintaining a structured and organized codebase. Dive into the world of modular neural networks and unlock the potential of customizable network architectures.
